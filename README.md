visualizing the variety of ways the Detroit Lions have ruined football for me. Using R, Python, and D3. Inspired by [this thread on Hacker News] (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5002974).

Also inspired by [this guy](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/imported_assets/969427/1992-February-2-19-13-45.jpg).
